💳 Online Payments Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
📌 Introduction

With the rapid growth of digital transactions, online payment fraud has become a major financial threat. Fraudulent activities can lead to significant monetary losses and security risks. This project focuses on developing a Machine Learning model to automatically detect fraudulent transactions and improve payment security systems.

🎯 Aim of the Project

The main aim of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify online transactions as Fraudulent or Legitimate using machine learning algorithms.

🧠 Problem Statement

Manual detection of fraudulent transactions is time-consuming and inefficient. Therefore, an automated system is required to analyze transaction patterns and identify suspicious activities in real time.
